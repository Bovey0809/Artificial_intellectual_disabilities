# consider and discuss about the features of 3D printer
- speed
    - 3D printer can operate at printing speeds of up to 250 millimeters per second, and travel speeds as high as 400 millimeters per second. For 3D printer time is critical, now the speed is quite higher than before, which allow it to be practical to production.
- size
    - Size limitation is currently a major drawback with most 3D printers on the market. With a huge build platform, the 3D printer can print large models without having to print in multiple pieces.
- accuracy
    - With a 40 micron minimum layer height, and an X, Y resolution of 20 microns, the 3D printers are extremely accurate. 3D printer has worked hard on balancing resolution and speed, now some comapnies can produce quite fine accuracy machines.
- durability
    - 3D printer is used as a tool on a daily basis for production line. This requires a durable machine that requires little maintenance. The durability is one important factor to be considered.
- materials
    - The list continues to grow……At 40 materials and counting, the possibilities are endless. With a large temperature range, and the ability to reach up to 320C on the hotend, the 3D printer is able to print with numerous materials, ranging from PLA and ABS to TPU, Nylon and Polycarbonate.

# Consider and discuss about the features of 4 instruments.
## Caliper
calipers look are the most simple in construction, featuring two sliding scales that you can align to give higher precision measurements than a standard steel ruler can provide. The first scale shows large graduations (typically inches), while the second set of graduations show smaller graduations (usually 1/128 inches). To measure, you place your calipers on your component and look for the graduation lines that align which gives you the necessary information to do some simple addition to figure out your dimension.

- advantages
The biggest advantages to calipers are their cost and the fact that they really don’t require any calibration. Since they are so simple in construction, cost of entry is extremely low. 
Another advantage to their simplicity is that there really isn’t anything to calibrate as they are basically just steel rulers that are attached to a set of jaws that slide past each other. This means that you can basically just throw them into your tool cabinet until the next use.

- disadvantages
When it comes to disadvantages, the style caliper is probably the least used of the three because versus a dial or electronic caliper it tends to be more complex and slower to read, particularly for amateur machinists. That said, they are extremely functional once you learn how to use them and they are very cost efficient compared to their dial end electronic counterparts.

## digital caliper
Digital or electronic calipers are arguably the most common used type of caliper found in auto repair shops and manufacturing environments. They come in many lengths and sizes to fit every budget and project, they are available with different jaw lengths and styles, and thankfully they can convert between both metric and inches with the push of a button. Digital calipers are definitely easier to read than Vernier and dial calipers, and some of the high-end models have data output and memory features among other functions. They can set the zero point at any place in the measurement range which makes them beneficial if measuring in reference to pre-existing dimensions.
While digital calipers are becoming more and more evolved as far as functions available, they still face the problem that pervades the technology industry: battery life. The lower priced caliper sets have batteries than don’t last very long and can require frequent changing, which is mildly annoying in the best of cases. The cheaper versions can also face environmental issues with liquids, and if they become damaged they are difficult enough to fix that you might as well just buy a new caliper. Fortunately, the best digital calipers don’t really have these issues though.

## micrometer
The most common used micrometer is the mechanical model. It applies the working principle of the screw and nut to create an amazing magnification. Equipped with two major scales: sleeve scale (stationary) and thimble scale (rotating). To gain greater resolution, some mechanical micrometers etch additional vernier scale on the sleeve scale above the index line. For those who are still beginners, using this type of micrometer is very fun and appropriate to practice how to calculate the reading.

- Advantages:
Affordable and easy to get. It has a reasonable price compared to the digital and dial in general.
Last for a Longer Time. A mechanical micrometer feels heavy probably because of its material, steel. Steel is a strong, stiff, weight, and durable material to improve the quality of a product. Moreover, proper and careful uses can help extend the life span.
Can be used in a harsh environment. No need to worry to use it in an oily or magnetic field environment.
No battery. As long as it is in good condition, no need for any electrical power source.

- Disadvantages:
The reading takes time. If you’re not familiar with it, you may need a note to calculate the measurement.
Chance of error. The angle of reading has to be straight into the center of the barrel.
One Unit Measurement. The scale is only available in one unit measurement. In other words, it is just in metric (mm) or imperial (inch). You have to convert the result manually to another unit.

## digital micrometer
A digital micrometer is a product of excellent technology that employs an electronic circuit to manipulate the capacitance into numbers. You don’t need to make any calculation because the measurement result has been displayed on the LCD screen. Even, there is a slot for a cable available to transfer the data of measurement into another electronic device. People buy a digital micrometer in hope to get a fast, easy, and accurate reading. Therefore, when you are buying a new micrometer, the digital model should be one of your consideration.

- Advantages:
Fast Reading. As the measurement taken by the device, the reading is displayed. As long as the product is the good one, the reading is highly adorable.
Small Error. It totally eliminates the errors gained by the users.
Switch to Mechanical. In case the battery is running out of power, it’s still useful because you can switch to the conventional way. Or you just want to have fun, the scale thimble and sleeve are still there.
Easy Conversion. Generally, a digital micrometer provides conversion button to let you easily convert the reading to mm or inch.
Zeroing Made Easy. Unlike zeroing the mechanical model which has to rotate the sleeve barrel to align the index line to mark 0 of thimble scale, zeroing in digital micrometer is very easy. You can zero it at any position you like simply by hitting the zero button.
Transferrable Data. Your measurement data can be transferred, stored, and analyzed on the other devices.

- Disadvantages:
Sensitive to External Environment. Dust and water is the enemy of a digital micrometer. They can damage the inside content of digital micrometer. If you want to make sure the micrometer can perform consistently for a longer time, buy the coolant proof one. Mitutoyo is a company that produces micrometer with this technology.
Battery. When the battery is out of power, you have to buy a new one.
Expensive. In general, a digital micrometer costs about hundreds of dollar. However, it’s reasonable in regard to its excellent performance.
